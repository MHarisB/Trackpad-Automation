TrackPad Automation System
============================

A minimal and simple script written in Matlab, which uses your webcam to control the movement and simulate the click events of your mouse by simple color recognition techniques. Curretly, it can detect only Red, Blue and Green colors. The script is really easy to run. The code is well commented and documented, so that you could modify it as per your needs. 

##Inputs

         Red Cap = Threshold for red color detection
 
         Green Cap = Threshold for green color detection
         
         Blue Cap = Threshold for blue color detection
         
         Number of Frames = Total number of frames duration
         
 Adjust the value of thresholds for different environments inside the code. 
 
##Controls

 Use One RED, One GREEN and Three BLUE Caps for different fingers.
           
           MOVE the red finger everywhere to control the POINTER POSITION.
           
           Show one blue finger to LEFT CLICK.
           
           Show two fingers with blue caps to RIGHT CLICK.
           
           Show three fingers with blue caps to DOUBLE CLICK.
           
           MOVE the GREEN finger up and down to control the MOUSE SCROLL.

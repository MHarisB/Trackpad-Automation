TrackPad Automation System
============================

MouseControl controls the functions of mouse pointer without
incorporating the Mouse.

##Inputs

         Red Cap = Threshold for red color detection
 
         Green Cap = Threshold for green color detection
         
         Blue Cap = Threshold for blue color detection
         
         Number of Frames = Total number of frames duration
         
 Adjust the value of thresholds for different environments inside the code.
